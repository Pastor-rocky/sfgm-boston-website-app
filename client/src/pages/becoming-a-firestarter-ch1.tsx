                  presence in your life, where it's all about Him and nothing else matters except 
                  pleasing God through your words and deeds and helping others do the same.

                    A lot of people say that someone is on fire for God only to find out later down the

                    more than before. People also say they are on fire for God, but then something 
                    happens, whether it be trials or temptations, and they fall back into their old sinful 
                    lifestyle as well and now all they have is their memory of the past when they used 
                    to be on fire for God. Why is this happening to people in the church today?

                <Paragraph>
                  For fifteen years of my life I attended church off and on. At church I would go 
                  through the motions and even sing in the choir; however, outside of church I was a 
                  completely different person. I physically abused my wife, I cheated on her, I 
                  treated my kids horribly, I had five crooked businesses, and I was filled with pride 
                  and anger. I was violent, fighting anyone who even gave me a hint of attitude––
                  once I pushed my own father through a wall. I was a scammer, a liar, a thief, and an 
                  adulterous person who used to party several times a week, getting drunk out of my 
                  mind. My wife was a fortune teller and I often conspired with her to con her 
                  customers.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                  The worst part of all this is I thought I was a Christian because I used to go to 
                  church and put a little money in the offering. I used to look at people in church and 
                  say to myself, "man I want what they have"; I didn't understand it––I went to 
                  church, I believed in Jesus, but why wasn't I excited like they were, why couldn't I 
                  get involved in the worship like they did, why didn't I have the zeal they had, why 
                  am I not on fire for God like them?

                <Paragraph>
                  I really thought I was a Christian so I should have had what they had. One day, in 
                  October of 2004, I started to realize why I didn't have what they had. My mother 
                  in-law came in town and she said to me "Anthony you can go to church, you can 
                  pray, you can fast, and you can sing in the choir but if you are not in the Word of 
                  God it is all meaningless."
                </Paragraph>
                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-green-400 pl-4 mb-4 italic text-gray-800">

                    "You can go to church, you can pray, you can fast, and you can sing in the choir

                </blockquote>
                <Paragraph>
                  Then she gave me a Bible book store address and told me to go and buy a bible, 
                  so I listened and respected what she said because she was a person that 
                  preached Christianity with her mouth shut. What do I mean by saying that? She 
                  lived Christianity––not just talked about it. I used to treat her daughter horribly but 
                  she never argued with me, she never said anything negative to me, the only thing 
                  she did was pray for me. So that day I went and bought my first Bible, a New Living 
                  Translation. It was a Bible that can be read through in a year and it was an easy to 
                  understand Bible.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                  That day I started reading. I started in the Gospel of John, and in a few days I 
                  realized that I really wasn't a Christian and if I was to die I would have gone to Hell 
                  (Galatians 5:19). I also realized God's grace and love for my life and for the world 
                  (John 3:16). I also realized why I wasn't like the other people in the church who 
                  appeared to be passionately on fire for God; it was because of my sinful lifestyle 
                  and my unwillingness to obey His Word.

                  I started reading the Bible every day and in one year I read the whole Bible cover 
                  to cover. In that year God delivered me from pride, anger, bitterness, adultery, lust, 
                  drinking, smoking, slander, gossiping, lying, scamming, witchcraft, and cheating. I 
                  gave up all the crooked businesses!

                    In that year I started hosting Bible studies in the basement of my house. In 2004 it 
                    started with about 15 people. We were set on fire; it was like the day of Pentecost 
                    with the disciples in the upper room! Since then until now, 2011, it has grown into a 
                    full-blown ministry with the Church of God. The Church of God denomination has 
                    given us a building; the building they gave us is the church I grew up in. I am now 
                    the pastor of the church I grew up in! Only God can do that.

                  My point of telling you a part of my testimony is this––God can change anyone if 
                  they are willing to be changed. Jesus said "the spirit is willing but the flesh is 
                  weak" (Matthew 26:41). If God can change my life He can change anyone's; if you 
                  allow the Holy Spirit to move in your life through the Word of God that you are 
                  going to read in this book you will be set on fire by God and your life will never be 
                  the same!

                <Paragraph>
                  When you look at the story of Cain and Abel you will discover the first offering 
                  unto the Lord. There were actually two offerings, but only one was acceptable to 
                  God.
                </Paragraph>
                <div className="mb-6">

                      After some time Cain brought some of his harvest and gave it as an offering to the 
                      LORD. Then Abel brought the first lamb born to one of his sheep, killed it, and 
                      gave the best parts of it as an offering. The LORD was pleased with Abel and his 
                      offering, but he rejected Cain and his offering. Cain became furious, and he 
                      scowled in anger.

                      you had done the right thing, you would be smiling; but because you have done 
                      evil, sin is crouching at your door. It wants to rule you, but you must overcome it."

                  If you notice in the story, Cain brought some of his harvest while Abel brought the 
                  best he had. One was a farmer, one was a Shepherd; they each brought what they 
                  had from their labors, but one gave the best while the other merely gave some. 
                  Why didn't God accept it? The answer might be that God cursed the ground 
                  because Adam had disobeyed God's Word.

                  <Paragraph>
                    This is just like us today. We try to give God some of our lives but not all and not 
                    the best. Incomplete obedience is total disobedience! Then we, like Cain, get 
                    upset at God and other people in the church because we are not receiving our 
                    blessings and we are not being used and we say things like, "I don't understand 
                    why God is doing this to me," or, "why is that person getting blessed and I'm not?".

                <Paragraph>
                  Could it be that you are not giving your all to the Lord? See, Cain gave God 
                  something that was from the ground that was previously cursed and God didn't 
                  accept it. You cannot live a life of disobedience like I was living prior to my born 
                  again experience and expect God to answer your prayers, bless you and set you on 
                  fire. The Bible says when you live in disobedience you fall in to the curse of the 
                  world. (Deuteronomy 28:15-20). You might say Jesus took all the curses of the 
                  world and the curse of sin; He did (see Galatians 3:13), but if you are not abiding in 
                  Jesus, living for Him, and obeying Him, you disqualify yourself from this (John 15) 
                  and you, like Cain, open the door to Satan (Genesis 4:7) and allow him to destroy 
                  you. You end up living a cursed, miserable, angry life because of disobedience to 
                  God.

                    If you were to bring a sacrifice back then to the temple the priest would take the 
                    animal and usually cut the neck, meaning the animal is not coming back. So to 
                    present yourself as a living sacrifice means to constantly die to self on an every 
                    day level––it means to constantly crucify the flesh and not give in to the lust of the 
                    flesh, lust of the eye and the pride of life (1 John 2:16-17).

                  When you want to live a life like that then you will know the will of God and then 
                  you will be pleasing to Him and then God will accept your offering which is your

                <Paragraph>
                  What does the story have to do with fire? Well, when you would bring a sacrifice to 
                  the priests they would put it on the altar and burn it. Before the tabernacle or the 
                  temple was built and established God would accept people's offerings by sending 
                  fire from heaven to consume it. Some theologians and scholars believe the reason 
                  Cain knew God didn't accept His offering is because God didn't send fire from 
                  heaven to consume it. They believe God sent fire from heaven to consume Abel's 
                  offering and that is how Cain knew God did not accept his offering.

                        pot, brought them to the LORD's angel under the oak tree, and gave them to him.

                    In the story we are going to look at, Israel was living in idolatry, worshipping the

                    have to do our own thing to be provided for, so we scam, steal, and connive to get 
                    what we want, which is idolatry. We worship money, and Jesus said we have a 
                    choice––either serve God or money, you cannot serve both! The Israelites should 
                    have remembered that one of the names of God is Jehovah-jireh, the Lord our

                    <Paragraph>
                      You may notice in the story that Elijah rebuilt the altar of the LORD. It is time for us 
                      to realize it is not only about praying, dancing, and shouting– it is about rebuilding 
                      in your life what God wanted from the beginning, a person that will lay down their 
                      life and sacrifice all for Him! When you do that people will notice God's fire in your 
                      life and they will return to the LORD as the people in the story did. They also 
                      caught the false prophets and killed every one of them. It is time for us to stand 
                      out like Elijah did; God has not called us to blend in, He has called us to stand out!

                    In this story King Solomon just finished building the temple of the LORD and he is 
                    dedicating it to God; this is where the offerings were to be brought. He prays in 
                    chapter six that God will live in the temple, that God will help His people, He will 
                    hear their prayers, and when the people mess up if they will repent He will forgive 
                    them and restore them.

                  If you keep reading you will see that the altar was not big enough to hold all the

                  yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to 
                  him. This is the true worship that you should offer" (Romans 12:1).
