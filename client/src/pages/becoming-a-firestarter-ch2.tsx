                <Paragraph>
                  Jesus said something that really amazed me. First He begins in Luke 12 talking 
                  about whom people should fear––not man but God, who has the authority to throw 
                  you in Hell. Then He starts talking about a man that made his life all about his 
                  possessions and he didn't acknowledge God, and how God required his soul from 
                  him one night and he was not ready for God. Then Jesus explains not to worry 
                  about things of the world but please God and He will add to your life. He continues 
                  and says how if He comes back and faithful servants are serving Him they will be 
                  rewarded but if He comes back and the servants are not faithful they will be 
                  punished then He says this:

                      over! Do you suppose that I came to bring peace to the world? No, not peace, but 
                      division. From now on a family of five will be divided, three against two and two 
                      against three."

                <Paragraph>
                  Jesus is saying that He came to set the world on Fire! Look at the context He says 
                  it in: talking about hell; a person who was living for himself, not worrying about life; 
                  then a faithful servant that gets rewarded; a servant that stops being faithful and 
                  gets punished; then he talks about how people are hypocritical.

                    It is simple, Jesus came to bring fire upon this earth so we will not have to face 
                    Hell's fire. In our houses today there are people who are on fire for God and there 
                    are people who are not on fire for God and do not fully want to submit themselves 
                    unto God! That is what He was saying about division in the house.

                  When Jesus said I wish you were one or the other, hot or cold, <strong>cold represents an

                  God</strong>. So we don't have a choice of being cold because people that confess Jesus 
                  are believers and believers in Jesus can either be hot, on fire, or lukewarm, 
                  claiming Christ but living like a nonbeliever!

                    nonbelievers, God could send someone that is on fire for Jesus to show them a 
                    true witness of Jesus. That is why Jesus introduces himself as the Faithful and

                    water-diluting pastors out there that do not preach the full Gospel of Jesus! This is

                <Paragraph>
                  In the text of Revelation three, Jesus says because you are lukewarm I will spit you 
                  out of my mouth! Back then in the days of the Laodicean church they had a water 
                  problem in the city so they had to build an aqueduct (like a bridge/piping system) 
                  to bring in the water from a city six miles away. The water used to enter into the 
                  aqueduct ice cold, but by the time it traveled six miles to enter Laodicea the 
                  desert sun had been beaming on it so by the time it came out of the aqueduct it 
                  was lukewarm!
                </Paragraph>

                <Paragraph>
                  So Jesus was basically illustrating that <strong>the same way the lukewarm water is 
                  disgusting to you is the same way your lifestyle is disgusting to me!</strong> So if Jesus 
                  spits us out of His mouth it means to cast us out of His presence.
