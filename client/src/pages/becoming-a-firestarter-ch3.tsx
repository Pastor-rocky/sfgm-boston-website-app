                <Paragraph>
                  I was in the east coast in May of 2011 on a six day crusade, and on one of those 
                  days I was scheduled to preach in Washington, D.C., for a pastor friend of mine, 
                  Pastor Frank. I was actually going to preach a sermon on how to get on fire for 
                  God, and on the way there my van ran out of gas. I was so frustrated; we were only 
                  blocks from the church when it ran out of gas. The church service had to start 
                  without us, we were 30 minutes late. I was upset at one of my guys that was on the 
                  trip with me because he was driving and he didn't pay attention to the gas gauge.
                </Paragraph>

                  <p className="font-semibold mb-2">💡 God's Lesson from Running Out of Gas</p>
                  <Paragraph>
                    I start walking in frustration, and then God ministered to me and said, <strong>"I'm going to 
                    use this in the sermon tonight so calm down."</strong> So I did; we got some gas and went 
                    to church and the fire of God fell on that place like I haven't seen in a long time!
                  </Paragraph>
                </InfoBox>

                <Paragraph>
                  The point God gave me about the gas is this: <strong>to have fire you need fuel.</strong> You're 
                  responsible to make sure you have the fuel. No one else is to blame, you have to 
                  constantly watch your spiritual gauge and can never allow yourself to run out 
                  because you might be close to where God wants you, but it's not about being 
                  close it's about being right on for the glory of God!
                </Paragraph>

                <Paragraph>
                  Don't get me wrong, I'm a person who runs out of gas a lot. I just don't pay attention or sometimes I think I 
                  can stretch the gas longer than it can go. We will not be perfect in this life with 
                  God, but God sure does want us to try. The word <em>perfect</em> in the Greek means 
                  "mature"; it is time to grow up and put gas in the car and make sure it never gets 
                  low.

                  Sometimes you see people and they look like they are on fire for God but then the 
                  fire dies down. Why is this? The answer is found in In Luke chapter eight. Jesus 
                  gave an illustration about a man that sowed some seed on four different types of 
                  ground, then later He explained the story to the disciples more clearly.

                      side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of 
                      their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock are they, 
                      which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which 
                      for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among 
                      thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares 
                      and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. But that on 
                      the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the 
                      word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. No man, when he hath lighted a

                <Paragraph>
                  I love this quote from John Wesley: <strong>"If we get on fire for God people will come 
                  watch us burn."</strong> That is what it is all about, showing God's glory!

                <Paragraph>
                  This quote reminds me of a story about Moses. In the book of Exodus chapter three Moses, 
                  after forty years of being gone from Egypt, gets called by God to help bring His 
                  people out of bondage and slavery. The way God did it is what amazes me.

                      Moses is tending His father-in-law's sheep when something happened... One day while 
                      Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the 
                      priest of Midian, he led the flock across the desert and came to Sinai, the holy 
                      mountain. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him as a flame coming from 
                      the middle of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire but that it was not 
                      burning up. "This is strange," he thought. "Why isn't the bush burning up? I will go 
                      closer and see." When the LORD saw that Moses was coming closer, he called to 
                      him from the middle of the bush and said, "Moses! Moses!" He answered, "Yes, 
                      here I am."

                    Moses probably saw many burning bushes in the desert but there was something 
                    strange about this bush––<strong>it wasn't burning out!</strong> So Moses gets curious. He never 
                    saw a bush on fire that did not burn out, so he leaves what he is doing to check it 
                    out. When He gets there it is the Lord Himself! The LORD gives Moses a mission to 
                    go back to Egypt and bring the people out of bondage.

                  I want to connect it to the church. People have seen their share of burnouts in the 
                  church, but when people start hearing and seeing people on fire for God that don't 
                  burn out but keep on burning for the Lord what will happen is people will stop what 
                  they are doing to talk to you. They will stop what they're doing and they will come 
                  to your church. They will see the the light from the fire in you and your ministry 
                  and they will be drawn to you to hear what you have to say (Moses' name actually 
                  means drawn out), what your church leader has to say, and when they do they will 
                  get a Word from you because when you are on fire for God you will always have a 
                  Word.

                  <Paragraph>
                    Don't focus on what you don't understand in the Bible. <strong>Focus 
                    instead on what you do understand, and apply that.</strong> In time, the Holy Spirit will 
                    lead you into deeper truths, and you will continually understand more as you grow 
                    deeper in the Lord.
