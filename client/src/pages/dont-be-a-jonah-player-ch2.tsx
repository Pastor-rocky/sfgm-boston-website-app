                <p>So the reason why Jonah was so against what God wanted him to do is because he was bitter. One of the biggest problems in the world in general and even in the church is bitterness. A bitter root doesn't just develop in a person's life over night; it all starts with a person being offended. Jesus even told us in the end times many people will be offended.</p>

                <p>I read a book called "The Bait of Satan" by John Bevere. In this book the author explains the dangers of being offended and allowing the enemy to instill bitterness in a person's heart. The word for "offense" found in Matthew 24:10 is the greek word skandalon. It is where we get our English word for scandal. The word skandalon was also the name of a lever that sets off a trap and catches the victim in its claws because they fell for the bait that was connected to the lever.</p>

                <p>This comes in many forms, like maybe:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                  <li>God didn't answer your prayer so now you're bitter at God</li>
                  <li>A certain person didn't acknowledge you or didn't show you the affection you thought they should</li>
                  <li>A pastor that didn't do what you expected him to do</li>
                  <li>A family member that didn't come through</li>
                  <li>A friend that let you down</li>
                  <li>Someone who hurt you or someone close to you</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Whatever it is that offended you it then becomes a scandal! You start complaining about it and telling others how you were done wrong. The people that you tell don't know both sides of the story fully, so they side with you and then that makes you feel justified as if you are in the right about the wrong that was done to you.</p>

You're angry because it's not resolved and they haven't said they are sorry, and they feel that they're right and you're wrong.</p>

                <p>Think about Cain and Abel. Cain got so angry because he was offended that God didn't receive his offering, and because of this he took it out on his brother because Abel's offering was accepted and his offering was rejected.</p>
                
                <p>God warned Cain that the enemy was at the door and wanted to rule over him. God tried to get him to control his anger but Cain didn't listen.</p>

                  <p className="mt-3">Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him. In the process, one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars. He couldn't pay, so his master ordered that he be sold—along with his wife, his children, and everything he owned—to pay the debt.</p>
                  <p className="mt-3">But the man fell down before his master and begged him, 'Please, be patient with me, and I will pay it all.' Then his master was filled with pity for him, and he released him and forgave his debt.</p>
                  <p className="mt-3">But when the man left the king, he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars. He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment. His fellow servant fell down before him and begged for a little more time. 'Be patient with me, and I will pay it,' he pleaded. But his creditor wouldn't wait. He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.</p>
                  <p className="mt-3">When some of the other servants saw this, they were very upset. They went to the king and told him everything that had happened. Then the king called in the man he had forgiven and said, 'You evil servant! I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me. Shouldn't you have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?' Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt.</p>

Because of the bitter root Jonah had he was running from the very reason he was created and called to serve God. Maybe without realizing it you are running from God's call and purpose for your life because you have been hurt and you are not willing to resolve the problem by forgiving and forgetting? If that's the case it's time to let it go and release the person(s) that have hurt and hindered you from the call that is on your life. Don't let it happen; stop holding onto something Jesus died to forgive!</p>

                  <p>About two years before I answered the call to become a minister, one of the hardest things in my life happened to me. That was the enemy's way to try to make me become offended at God, angry at a person, and bitter because of what happened.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3"><strong>My mother was murdered and it was her husband, my stepfather that did it!</strong></p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">He was a cruel, evil man that had accusations against him of murdering others in the past before he ever murdered my mother. I tried to tell my mother not to marry him and I even tried to tell her to leave him weeks before she was murdered by him, but she wouldn't listen.</p>

                  <p>One day I got a phone call that she was on life support from a head injury. I took the next flight out from Chicago to New York. When I finally got to the hospital, I thought I was going to fight with this man that did this to my mother.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">I entered the hospital room and I saw my mother, who was only forty-one years old at the time, filled with hoses and connected to machines. There were scars on her arms and neck from what looked like a fight she was in from a few weeks before when I spoke to her about leaving him.</p>

                  <p>I soon began to pray and ask God to help my mother and take her out of the coma she was in. After I finished praying I sat down and began to read the Bible. As I was reading the Bible, moments later the man that put my mother in a coma and murdered her walked in!</p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">I got off my chair and stood up thinking I'm gonna fight with this man, but something happened—<strong className="text-green-300">God filled me with peace and love; I couldn't believe it!</strong></p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">I began to tell him about Jesus and how only Jesus could help my mother, because he told me he prays to a saint called Guadalupe. I told him how Jesus was the one true God.</p>

                  <p>You might be thinking why wasn't he arrested? He covered her murder up by getting rid of the evidence that he hit her in the head with, then washed her body after she was knocked out to make it look like she fell getting out of the shower and after that he liquified pills and made her ingest it to make it look like the reason she fell was because she took too many sleeping pills. After this he put her in bed and called the ambulance twenty hours later. He then told the ambulance that she fell getting out of the shower, hitting her head, then she laid down after to get some rest but the next day wouldn't get up.</p>
                  
                  <p className="mt-3">Why do I know all this? My wife Gina, her aunt was married to the man's son that murdered my mother. They told my wife's aunt that if she ever told anyone they would do the same to her. Also, this man had connections with the police in the district he lived in; this man was an organized crime criminal. No matter what, though, God has all control over every government official (Rom 13). The point is, when God wants him to go to jail he will do it on his time and his way. Revenge is The LORD's not ours!</p>

                <p>The day I had to sign the papers to pull the plug on the life support that was keeping my mother in a comatose state, I was in the room with my mother and he walked in.

                  <p>As soon as he left the room, God began to minister to me to go and tell him I was sorry! I said, "God, why would you want me to do this? You know what he did." God told me, <em>"I'm going to use you to display my love through your forgiveness and obedience."</em></p>

                  <p className="mt-3">He's still not in jail, but I did hear that he began to go to church. What's the point? Vengeance is the Lord's. It's our responsibility to forgive and its God's responsibility to serve justice in His time and in His way.</p>
